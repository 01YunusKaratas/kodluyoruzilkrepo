    <p>
        Hello, I'm <mark>Yunus Emre Karata≈ü</mark>. I am a computer engineering student at Manisa Celal Bayar University. Coding, exercising, and learning new things are among my hobbies. I have knowledge in various programming technologies such as
        <mark>Python, Flask, Django, Java, Html, CSS, and JavaScript</mark>, and I continue to improve myself in these areas. As someone dedicated to technology and the software world, I enjoy creating new projects and using my coding skills to solve problems. Additionally, I prioritize maintaining my mental and physical health through sports. I am open to learning new things and constantly seize opportunities to improve myself. Through this form website I have created, we can log in and add the books we have read, and see who has read which book. Additionally, we can write about what the book is about. I created this form website to socialize online and create opportunities for ourselves to discover new books.
